# Reports

This directory contains generated analysis reports, figures, and tables from the experiments.

## Structure

- `figures/` - Generated plots, charts, and visualizations
- `tables/` - Generated data tables (CSV, Markdown, or LaTeX format)

## Contents

Reports generated by this project will include:

### Figures
- Data distribution plots
- Correlation matrices
- Feature importance plots
- ROC curves and precision-recall curves
- Cross-validation performance comparisons
- Hyperparameter tuning visualizations

### Tables
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
- Statistical test results (paired t-tests, Wilcoxon, Friedman)
- Hyperparameter configurations
- Feature engineering comparisons
- Confusion matrices

## Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, structured names:

- **Figures**: `<experiment>_<plot_type>_<description>.png`
  - Example: `baseline_roc_curve_all_models.png`
  - Example: `enhanced_feature_importance_rf.png`

- **Tables**: `<experiment>_<table_type>_<description>.csv`
  - Example: `baseline_cv_results_all_models.csv`
  - Example: `statistical_tests_model_comparison.csv`

## Usage

Reports are generated by the experiment scripts in `src/scripts/`. Visualization code should be modularized and placed in appropriate modules.

## Version Control

Unlike the `data/` directory, the contents of `reports/` **are tracked by git**. This allows us to:
- Document experimental results
- Track how results change over time
- Share findings with collaborators
- Include figures in the final report

Keep generated files organized and avoid committing temporary or redundant outputs.
